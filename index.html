    <p class = "longtext">Hello, my name is Madeleine Kusel. I am 22
      years old and I currently reside in Manchester Center, VT. In May of 2020,
      I graduated from Wesleyan University with a B.A. in Mathematics and Computer
      Science. I am passionate about education, uplifting the LGBTQ+ community and
      how digital media impacts our culture. I am a certified ski instructor(Alpine
      Level One and Children's Specialist One) and I have been working at Bromley
      Mountain for the past 8 years. I am currently looking for meaningful work
      in software or working for nonprofits that uplift the Queer community.</p>
